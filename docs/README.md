# SmartPi-GPIO

SmartPi-GPIO is a Python package that provides comprehensive control over GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) pins for Smart Pi One (SBCs) running Armbian. It supports basic GPIO operations, PWM, I2C-based components like the PCA9685, OLED screens, and GPIO interrupts. It also includes a web-based interface to control the GPIO remotely.

## Features
- Basic GPIO read/write operations
- PWM control via PCA9685
- GPIO interrupt support
- Web-based interface using Flask
- Control OLED displays over I2C
- Post-installation scripts for setting up GPIO interfaces
